# Git Commit & Push Workflow

Use this workflow to safely version control your changes.

## 1. Check Status

- [ ] Check the status of your changes: `git status`.
- [ ] Review the changes to ensure you are only committing what you intend.

## 2. Stage Changes

- [ ] Add all changes: `git add .` OR add specific files `git add [filename]`.

## 3. Commit

- [ ] Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Your descriptive message"`.

## 4. Push

- [ ] Push changes to the current branch: `git push`.
