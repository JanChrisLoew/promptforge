# Project Context: PromptForge

## Overview
PromptForge is a professional, standalone Single Page Application (SPA) designed for "Prompt Engineering". It allows users to create, organize, version, and export AI prompts locally.

## Core Philosophy
- **Local-First:** Data is persisted in the browser's LocalStorage. No backend is required.
- **Privacy:** No data leaves the user's browser unless explicitly exported.
- **Speed:** Instant interactions, optimized for desktop usage.
- **Professional UX:** A clean, IDE-like interface tailored for editing text and managing metadata.

## Key Features
1.  **Library Management:** Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) prompts.
2.  **Versioning:** Save snapshots (versions) of prompts with commit notes. Restore previous versions.
3.  **Organization:** Categorization, Tagging, and Search/Filter functionality.
4.  **Import/Export:** Full library backup via JSON or single prompt export.
5.  **Safe Editing:** Duplicate detection and confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
