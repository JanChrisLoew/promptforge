# Project Context: PromptForge

## Overview

PromptForge is a professional, standalone Single Page Application (SPA) designed for "Prompt Engineering". It features a dual-view architecture (Landing Page & Dashboard) allowing users to manage AI prompts in a local-first environment.

## Core Philosophy

- **Local-First:** Data is persisted in the browser's LocalStorage. No backend is required.
- **Privacy:** No data leaves the user's browser unless explicitly exported.
- **Speed:** Instant interactions, optimized for desktop usage.
- **Professional UX:** A clean, IDE-like interface with in-app modals and a global landing-to-dashboard flow.
- **Privacy Transparency:** Dedicated security information highlights our commitement to local-only data.

## Key Features

1. **Library Management:** Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) prompts.
2. **Versioning:** Save snapshots (versions) of prompts with commit notes. Restore previous versions.
3. **Organization:** Categorization, Tagging, and Search/Filter functionality.
4. **Import/Export:** Full library backup via JSON or single prompt export.
5. **Safe Editing:** Duplicate detection and confirmation dialogs for destructive actions.
