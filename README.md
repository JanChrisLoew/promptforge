## 🌟 Vision

PromptForge is designed for developers and AI enthusiasts who need a professional environment to draft, organize, and version-control their prompts without relying on external cloud storage. It’s local-first, privacy-conscious, and built for speed.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **📂 Organized Library**: Categorize prompts and use tags for lightning-fast retrieval.
- **🔄 Snapshot Versioning**: Save "snapshots" of your prompts. Iterate safely with a full history of your changes.
- **📋 Template Focused**: Separate System Instructions from User Prompts for clean engineering.
- **💾 Local Persistence**: Everything stays on your machine. Data is persisted in LocalStorage.
- **🚢 Portability**: Export your entire library or individual prompts as JSON for backup or sharing.
- **🎨 Modern UI**: A sleek, dark-themed (or custom themed) environment built for focus.
